# MEANstack

A piece of coursework I did at the Munich University of Applied Science.
It provides a simple GUI in which a user can segment an image. Segmentation data 
(for a 3D image) is saved in a MongoDB, and can be loaded by an administrator or 
a controlling routine through the api provided at app_api/.

Still under construction!
